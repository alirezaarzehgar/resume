Dear Parisa Naeemi,

As a passionate Cloud Engineer with over 4 years of experience, I have been a long-time fan of the Snapp development team. Working at Snapp feels like a dream, and if given the opportunity, I would be just as proud to be part of it as I am of my open-source contributions to the Go programming language and the valuable feedback I've received from senior developers at Google. I believe this position will make me even happier than I already am, as I am naturally a happy person.
I am a quick learner, and reading technical books is a dopamine source for me.

My journey began at the age of 15 when I wrote my first C code and spent my youth exploring Linux.
4 years ago I got my first job as an Embedded Network Engineer at ZharfPooyan Toos when I was 17.
In ZharfPooyan I worked on routers and switches using C and Unix-related technologies.
I automated performance testing of network appliances and designed a robust network lab here.

After my experience at ZharfPooyan, I became passionate about Cloud Computing and started my new journey
with Golang, Docker and the backend field. But every time I designed a backend solution
I kept in mind simplicity, correctness, being cloud-friendly and scalability.

I start work at Asrez Co companies as a Golang Developer. I learned some cloud-related
concepts and experience developing backend solutions. I developed a monitoring system with
Prometheus & Grafana to visualize over 10K loads per minute.

Like Asrez I was a Golang developer in Arttizens but I can mention that CI/CD and automated processes are one of my
important roles here.

If my story caught your interest, I invite you to hear a tale in an interview!

Sincerely,

Alireza Arzehgar
